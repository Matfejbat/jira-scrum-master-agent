# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The BeeAI Jira Scrum Master Agent is a sophisticated AI-powered system designed to automate and enhance Scrum Master activities through intelligent integration with Jira and the BeeAI platform. This document provides a comprehensive view of the system architecture using ArchiMate 3.2 modeling standards.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Multi-Agent Architecture
The system employs a multi-agent pattern where a main orchestrator agent routes requests to specialized sub-agents based on functionality:

```
Main Agent ‚Üí Sprint Analyzer (sprint health)
          ‚Üí Velocity Tracker (team metrics)
          ‚Üí Standup Facilitator (daily reports)
          ‚Üí Impediment Manager (blockers)
```

### Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration
Native Jira integration through MCP provides:
- Real-time data access
- Standardized protocol communication
- Scalable integration patterns

### Containerized Deployment
Docker-first approach enables:
- Consistent deployment environments
- Kubernetes orchestration
- CI/CD automation
- Scalable infrastructure

## Data Flow

1. **User Request** ‚Üí BeeAI Platform ‚Üí Main Agent
2. **Agent Processing** ‚Üí Specialized Agent ‚Üí MCP Client
3. **Data Retrieval** ‚Üí Jira REST API ‚Üí Jira System
4. **Response Generation** ‚Üí Agent Analysis ‚Üí User Response

## Integration Points

### BeeAI Platform
- Agent registration and lifecycle management
- Cross-agent communication
- User interface and authentication

### Jira Integration
- Sprint data retrieval
- Issue status monitoring
- Velocity calculations
- Impediment tracking

### External Services
- GitHub Container Registry for image distribution
- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment

## Security Considerations

- **API Authentication**: Secure Jira API token management
- **Container Security**: Non-root container execution
- **Network Security**: Encrypted communication channels
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions through BeeAI platform

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling
- Kubernetes pod scaling based on demand
- Load balancing across agent instances
- Distributed processing capabilities

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient MCP communication
- Caching strategies for Jira data
- Asynchronous processing patterns
